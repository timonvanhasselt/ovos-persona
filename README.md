# OVOS-Persona

`PersonaPipeline` adds multi-persona management to OpenVoiceOS (OVOS). Personas are configurable virtual assistants: each one assigns its own set of solver plugins to answer queries, so you can customize how OVOS handles a conversation.

See [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) for the architecture and API reference.

---

## Quick Start

1. Update the core and install the plugin:
   ```bash
   pip install -U "ovos-core>=0.5.1" ovos-persona
   ```
2. Install or update the plugins and skills a persona needs:
   ```bash
   pip install -U skill-wolfie ovos-skill-wikipedia ovos-skill-wikihow skill-wordnet ovos-openai-plugin
   ```
3. Uninstall the ChatGPT fallback skill, since `ovos-persona` replaces it:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall skill-ovos-fallback-chatgpt
   ```
4. Edit `mycroft.conf`. The `"..."` below is a placeholder for your existing pipeline entries, not literal text.
   ```json
   {
     "intents": {
         "persona": {
           "handle_fallback":  true,
           "default_persona": "Remote Llama"
         },
         "pipeline": [
             "stop_high",
             "converse",
             "ocp_high",
             "padatious_high",
             "adapt_high",
             "ovos-persona-pipeline-plugin-high",
             "ocp_medium",
             "...",
             "fallback_medium",
             "ovos-persona-pipeline-plugin-low",
             "fallback_low"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
5. Restart OVOS.
6. Check the logs to confirm the persona loaded without errors:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.local/state/mycroft/skills.log | grep persona
   ```
7. Read the [Persona Intents](#persona-intents) section for the voice commands.

## Features

- **Multiple personas**: manage a list of personas, each with its own solver plugins.
- **Dynamic switching**: activate a different persona at any time.
- **Per-session state**: the active persona and conversation memory are tracked per session, so concurrent conversations stay isolated.
- **Short-term memory**: a default short-term memory ships with `ovos-persona` and is always available. Swap it for any `opm.agents.memory` plugin through the `memory_module` config key. See [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md).
- **Conversational**: personas can handle utterances directly, without a matching skill.
- **Personalize**: create a persona with a simple `.json` file. See [docs/defining-personas.md](docs/defining-personas.md).

## Installation

```bash
pip install ovos-persona
```

---

## Persona Intents

The persona service supports voice intents for managing persona interactions: listing personas, checking the active persona, activating a persona, asking a persona a single question, and stopping the conversation. Each intent corresponds to a messagebus event.

See the [OVOS technical manual: Persona Pipeline](https://openvoiceos.github.io/beta-technical-manual/persona-pipeline/) for the full list of example utterances and bus events.

---

## Pipeline Configuration

Where you place `"ovos-persona-pipeline-plugin-high"` in the pipeline decides whether the active persona gets full control of an utterance, or only handles it after high-confidence skills fail to match. `"ovos-persona-pipeline-plugin-low"` handles utterances as a fallback even when no persona is explicitly active, replacing [OpenVoiceOS/ovos-skill-fallback-chatgpt](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-skill-fallback-chatgpt).

See the [OVOS technical manual: Persona Pipeline](https://openvoiceos.github.io/beta-technical-manual/persona-pipeline/) for the pipeline configuration strategies and example `mycroft.conf` snippets.

## Creating a Persona

Personas are configured with JSON files. A persona can come from:
1. a plugin (for example, the [OpenVoiceOS/ovos-openai-plugin](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-openai-plugin)), or
2. a user-defined JSON file in `~/.config/ovos_persona`.

Personas rely on [solver plugins](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/solvers/), which try to answer a query in sequence until one succeeds.

Example: a persona using a local OpenAI-compatible server. Save this as `~/.config/ovos_persona/llm.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "My Local LLM",
  "handlers": [
    "ovos-solver-openai-plugin"
  ],
  "ovos-solver-openai-plugin": {
    "api_url": "https://llama.smartgic.io/v1",
    "key": "sk-xxxx",
    "system_prompt": "helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly."
  }
}
```

A persona does not need an LLM. Simpler solvers work too, even without a GPU.

Example: OldSchoolBot, a persona built from non-LLM solvers.
```json
{
  "name": "OldSchoolBot",
  "handlers": [
    "ovos-solver-wikipedia-plugin",
    "ovos-solver-ddg-plugin",
    "ovos-solver-plugin-wolfram-alpha",
    "ovos-solver-wordnet-plugin",
    "ovos-solver-rivescript-plugin",
    "ovos-solver-failure-plugin"
  ],
  "ovos-solver-plugin-wolfram-alpha": {"appid": "Y7353-xxxxxx"}
}
```
Behavior:
- Searches online sources such as Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha.
- Falls back to offline word lookups through WordNet.
- Uses a local chatbot (RiveScript) for chitchat.
- The "failure" solver catches errors so the persona always returns a response.

## HiveMind Integration

This project includes a native [hivemind-plugin-manager](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/hivemind-plugin-manager) integration for interoperability with the HiveMind ecosystem.

- **Agent protocol**: [hivemind-persona-agent-plugin](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/hivemind-persona-agent-plugin) lets HiveMind satellites connect directly to a persona. See [docs/hivemind.md](docs/hivemind.md).
